# PyPods

A lightweight solution to execute Python dependencies in an isolated fashion.

This documentation will follow the classic philosophy of [A picture is worth a thousand words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words)

# Terminology
1. ```pods``` directory stores all the pods that will be used in the current project.
2. A ```pod``` is a container that contains its own Python interpreter, dependencies, and a ```pod.py``` file that exposes specific functions defined by the user.
3. A ```pod client``` is a file that calls the specific functions defined by the user.
4. A ```pod protocol``` is a way to exchange data between the pod and pod client. PyPods uses [binary json or bson](https://bsonspec.org/).

# How to use PyPods?

1. Install pypods package via ```pip install pypods```
2. From the project's ```root``` directory, create a file (say ```client.py```) and paste the following code.
```python
# client.py will communicate with the hello_world_pod pod
from pypods.pods import PodLoader

# name of the pod, and namespace to inject pod's functions.
pl = PodLoader("hello_world_pod", globals())
pl.load_pod()   # Load pod's namespace
pl.unload_pod() # Unload pod's namespace
```
if ```hello_world_pod``` does not exist then ```PodLoader``` will create a
```hello_world_pod``` pod in the ```pods/hello_world_pod/``` directory.

3. Navigate to ```pods/hello_world_pod/``` directory and observe the file structure. This is your pod.

```bash
hello_world_pod/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ venv/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bin/          (or Scripts/ on Windows)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ include/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pyvenv.cfg
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ pod.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

4. You can define functions inside a placeholder defined in the ```pod.py``` template file. Please don't change anything else in this file!

```python
# Template pod.py file inside the hello_world_pod pod.
"""
Write your module's functions in this area.
"""
def foo(x, y):
    return x + y

# Don't change anything here!
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from pypods.pods import PodListener
    pl = PodListener()  # PodListener will send output back to the pod client.
    msg = (
        pl.read_stdin()
    )  # Pod client writes function name and parameters to pod's stdin.
    if msg:
        # Unpack stdin to get function data
        function_name, args, kwargs = msg["name"], msg["args"], msg["kwargs"]
        try:
            # Check if function exists in pod module's namespace.
            # If yes, execute the function and send output back to the pod client.
            # If no, send error back to the pod client.
            if function_name in globals():
                function_output = globals()[function_name](*args, **kwargs)
                pl.write_stdout(function_output)
            else:
                pl.write_stderr(f"Function {function_name} does not exist in pod")
        except Exception as e:
            # Any error that occurs while calling the function is sent back to pod client.
            pl.write_stderr(str(e))
```

5. Go back to ```client.py``` and add the ```foo``` function.
```python
# client.py will communicate with the hello_world_pod pod
from pypods.pods import PodLoader

# name of the pod, and namespace to inject pod's functions.
pl = PodLoader("hello_world_pod", globals())
pl.load_pod()   # Load pod's namespace (This will now load the foo function).
foo_output = foo(1, 2) # Expected output = 1 + 2 = 3.
pl.unload_pod() # Unload pod's namespace
```

This demo shows how PyPod works. You ran a pod function ```foo``` without importing it into the ```client.py``` file!
See ```example/``` directory for a project example.
