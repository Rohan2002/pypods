# How?
1. Inside your root project directory, create a pods folder.
2. Create a directory within the pods folder. The name of the directory will be your pod name.
3. Inside the pod directory, create a ```pod_spec.py``` file. This file represents the actual pod.
The pod client will communicate with the pod to perform certain functions.
